  <p>about me: </p>    
  <p>My name is Jillian Aurisano and I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.uic.edu/"> University of Illinois at Chicago</a> and a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.evl.cs.uic.edu/">Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>.  My research in a nutshell is to explore how advanced graphics platforms- like <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=1971">ultra-resolution display walls</a> and <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2016">immersive 'hybrid reality' environments</a>- and input modalities- such as </a> and <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2051">natural language</a>- might help scientists understand, explore and derive insight from Big Data.  I have a particular interest in visualizing biological datasets, since I have a biology degree from the University of Chicago and a background in biology research.</p>
  <p>Outside of my research, I have several deep interests: First, I love my field, and believe there are far too few women in computing, so I do what I can to encourage women to explore careers in computing and support them once they are here.  I have been involved in the women in computer science club since beginning my MS degree, also at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Second, I believe that undergraduate research opportunities are very important, so I started a program to connect graduate and undergraduate students together to do research, and I have had the chance to work with some wonderful students.</p>
  <p> Thanks for visiting my site! </p>
