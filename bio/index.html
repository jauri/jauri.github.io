<div id="about">
<p>
<p>  There are 2 parts to my biography: pre-CS and post-CS.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Minneapolis area in MN.  You can read about completely true stereotypes of Minnesotans here.</p> 
<p>For college, I went to the University of Chicago.  It was a great fit for me and I loved being surrounded by other intense, passionate and geeky students who were interested in everything.  I did all sorts of stereotypically 'UofC' things while in college, including camping out in the Reg during finals week, auditing philosophy courses for fun, participating in scav hunt, buying too many books at the Seminary Coop, hanging out at the Med, playing capture the flag on the quad at midnight, etc.  For fun at the UofC, I joined a Korean drumming group.  I would love to go back in time and play the janggu with my old group.</p>
<p> During my first two years of college, I took lots of science courses (but no CS, more on that later), and discovered that I really loved reading about and discussing molecular biology research, and devising new ways to mess around with the molecular circuitry of model organisms to figure out how cells and pathways work.  I had the chance to do undergraduate research in two biology labs during my time as an undergrad: one which looked at how plants respond to insect infestations at the molecular level, and one which looked at how immune cells develop.  I got a few special funding awards for undergrad research and found the wet-lab work to be immensely challenging, but perhaps not my true passion (more on that later).</p>
<p>I developed an interest in religious studies, after auditing the Judaic Civillizations class in my second year and decided to pick up a second major in religious studies, starting in my third year of college.  For the record, my humanities degree was as tough, if not at times tougher, than my science degree.  For example, during finals week of my first semester focusing on religious studies I somehow found myself with 6 take-home essays (totalling something like 50 pages) and 3 final exams.  I believe that will stand as the hardest week of my academic life, survival of which is one of my proudest achievements.  I loved my Div school courses, and I even took some graduate-level courses in my senior year.I was proud to complete a thesis on authority in the Talmud, but realized that humanities research too was likely not my true passion (more on that later).</p>
<p>After college I had a brief stint working in public service as a University of Chicago Public Interest Fellow with the Chicago Public School's department of post-secondary education.  We worked to develop programs to help Chicago kids go to college.  If I end up going on in academia, I hope my exerience wrestling with college access and readiness disparities will help me be a better educator.</p>
<p>I then did a year of work in wet-lab research looking at gene splicing in yeast, and decided that I was officially "not a wet lab person", and needed a plan B. </p>
