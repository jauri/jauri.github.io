  <p>about me: </p>    
  <p>My name is Jillian Aurisano and I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a research assistant in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory.  My research is in data visualization and human computer interaction.  I am particularly interested in exploring ways that advanced and futuristic graphics platforms- such as tiled-display walls and immersive 'hybrid reality' environments- and input modalities- such as natural language and multi-user touch- might help us address challenges in data visualization.  I have a particular interest in visualizing biological datasets, since I have a background in biology research, both as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and post-graduation.  I am passionate about encouraging women to explore careers in computing, and have been involved in the women in computer science club since beginning my MS degree, also at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  
  <p> Thanks for visiting my site! </p>
