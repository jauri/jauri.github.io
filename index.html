  <p>about me: </p>    
  <p>My name is Jillian Aurisano and I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a research assistant in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory.  My research in a nutshell is to explore how advanced and 'futuristic' graphics platforms- like ultra-resolution display walls and immersive 'hybrid reality' environments- and input modalities - such as natural language- might help scientists understand, explore and derive insight from Big Data.  I have a particular interest in visualizing biological datasets, since I have a biology degree from the University of Chicago and a background in biology research. 
  <p>Outside of my research, I have several deep interests: First, I am passionate about encouraging women to explore careers in computing, and have been involved in the women in computer science club since beginning my MS degree, also at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Second, I love working with undergraduate students and believe that undergraduate research opportunities are vital, so I started a program to connect graduate-undergraduate students together to do research.</p>
  <p> Thanks for visiting my site! </p>
